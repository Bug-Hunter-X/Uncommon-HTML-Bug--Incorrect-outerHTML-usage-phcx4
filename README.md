# Uncommon HTML Bug: Incorrect outerHTML Usage

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML related to the incorrect usage of the `outerHTML` property when appending content to an existing element.

The bug arises from misusing `outerHTML` to append content, unintentionally replacing the entire element rather than adding to its content.
